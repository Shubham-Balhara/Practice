------------------------------------------jtg question------------------------------------------------------
1. you are given an array of integer. your task is to output the length of largest gp present in the series.
  e.g., input: 1,2,4,7,14,28,56,85
      output: 4
     complete the function: int largetGP(int arr[],int length)
     solution should be in o(n) time complexity and o(1) space complexity you can traverse the array only once.
     
2. you are given a tree you need to connect all node at same leve using neighbour pointer
  struct Node{
    int val;
    Node *left,*right,*neighbour;
   }
   eg.,                NULL <- 1
                             /   \
                   NULL <- 2   <- 3
                         /   \      \ 
               NULL <- 4   <- 5  <-- 6
  complete the function: void connectNeighbour(Node *root)
 
3. you are given a linked list containing positive and negative integers sorted in ascending order based on their absolute values.
  you need to sort the list in decending order based on their actual values.
  e.g.,    input: 1 -> 2 -> -3 -> -4 -> 5
          output: 5 -> 2 -> 1 -> -3 -> -4
        complete the function: Node *sortList(Node *head)
       solution should be in o(n) time complexity and o(1) space complexity you can traverse the array only once.
